### Hey there, I'm vio! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm primarily experienced in Java, however, I'm also familiar with basic web stuff. I know a little bit about Angular.
- I usually write software for Minecraft servers. I'm quite experienced with plugin development for Bukkit, BungeeCord and Velocity and optimization of the Spigot codebase. I'm also familiar with JDA for Discord integration.
- I have knowledge about creating microservices using Spring Boot.
- I'm familiar with relational and non-relational databases as well as K/V stores like Redis.

### Public Projects

- Unfortunately, I don't really have any public projects to put here as most of my work is not meant to be shared publically. However, you may want to check out my public (unfinished!) projects: [Origin (Minecraft Bukkit plugin)](https://github.com/vioodev/Origin) and [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/vioodev/Portfolio)

### Experience

- I'm Owner & Developer of [Curve](https://github.com/Curve-Network), 2022's leading Minecraft UHC network. I was doing everything dev-wise on the server, website, Bukkit & BungeeCord/Velocity plugins, optimization of the Spigot codebase, Spring Boot microservices for Discord, Twitter & website integration, administration of the dedicated server and much more. The project was started in December 2021 and discontinued in December 2022 due to an administrative decision.
- I used to be Developer on [PvPGym](https://twitter.com/PvPGymOfficial), a Minecraft Arena & UHC network. During my time as developer on the server, I was primarily working on their Bukkit plugin codebase. I'm not affiliated with the project anymore.
- I was the Head Developer of [Battle](https://twitter.com/BattleRIPNet), a Minecraft HCF & UHC network. Due to my position as Head Developer, I was managing their development team as well as developing plugins, optimizing the Spigot, and administrating their dedicated servers. I was there when the network was in early stages, so I was also working on the server's predecessor "Asuma Network". I'm not affiliated with the project anymore.
